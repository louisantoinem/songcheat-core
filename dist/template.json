Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.\n\nDescribed as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C.\n\nWith a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a time signature of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 beats per minute.\"\n\n################\n# GUITAR SETUP #\n################\n\n# Tuning: \"standard\", \"dropd\", \"eb\" or E/5,B/4,G/4,D/4,A/3,E/3\n# Capo: fret number or 0 if none\n# Both are optional: Tuning defaults to \"standard\" and Capo to \"0\"\n\nTUNING standard\nCAPO 0\n\n##########################\n# KEY AND TIME SIGNATURE #\n##########################\n\n# Key: C, Am, F, Dm, Bb, Gm, Eb, Cm, Ab, Fm, Db, Bbm, Gb, Ebm, Cb,\n#      Abm, G, Em, D, Bm, A, F#m, E, C#m, B, G#m, F#, D#m, C#, A#m\n# Time: $Symbol $BeatsPerBar $BeatDuration\n#       E.g. 4/4 4 :q, 12/8 4 :qd\n#       For common time signatures, you can just give the symbol:\n#       C, 4/4, 12/8, C|, 2/2, 6/4, 2/4, 6/8, 3/4, 9/8\n# Tempo: value in bpm (beats per minute)\n# Shuffle: empty string if none, or \":8\" or \":16\" for shuffled 8th resp. 16th notes\n# All are optional: Key defaults to \"C\", Time to \"4/4\", Tempo to 80 and Shuffle to none (\"\")\n\nKEY C\nTIME 4/4 4 :q\nTEMPO 76\nSHUFFLE \"\"\n\n##########\n# CHORDS #\n##########\n\n# Chord: $Name $Tablature $Fingering $Comment\n# You can use #
